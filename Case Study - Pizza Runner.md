| 30             |

---
### Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```TSQL
SELECT 
    r.runner_id, r.order_id,
    r.distance, r.duration, COUNT(c.order_id) as count_pizza,
    CONCAT(AVG(ROUND(r.distance*60/r.duration, 1)), ' km/h') as avg_runner_speed_for_each_delivery
FROM #runner_orders_temp as r

```
| runner_id | order_id | distance | duration | count_pizza | avg_runner_speed_for_each_delivery |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 1         | 1        | 20       | 32       | 1           | 37.5 km/h                        |
| 1         | 2        | 20       | 27       | 1           | 44.4 km/h                        |
| 1         | 3        | 13.4     | 20       | 2           | 40.2 km/h                        |
| 1         | 10       | 10       | 10       | 2           | 60 km/h                          |
| 2         | 4        | 23.4     | 40       | 3           | 35.1 km/h                        |

| 3         | 5        | 10       | 15       | 1           | 40 km/h                          |

* Runner ```1``` had the average speed from 37.5 km/h to 60 km/h
* Runner ```2``` had the average speed from 35.1 km/h to 93.6 km/h. With the same distance (23.4 km), order ```4``` was delivered at 35.1 km/h, while order ```8``` was delivered at 93.6 km/h. There must be something wrong here!
* Runner ```3``` had the average speed at 40 km/h

**2. Add an identity column ```record_id``` to ```#customer_orders_temp``` to select each ordered pizza more easily**
```TSQL
ALTER TABLE #customer_orders_temp
ADD record_id INT IDENTITY(1,1);

SELECT * FROM #customer_orders_temp;
```
  
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time              | record_id  |

**3. Create a new temporary table ```extrasBreak``` to separate ```extras``` into multiple rows**
```TSQL
SELECT 
    c.record_id,
    TRIM(e.value) AS extra_id
INTO #extrasBreak 
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(extras, ',') AS e;

| 14        | 1         |
| 14        | 4         |

**4. Create a new temporary table ```exclusionsBreak``` to separate into ```exclusions``` into multiple rows**
```TSQL
SELECT 
    c.record_id,
    TRIM(e.value) AS exclusion_id
INTO #exclusionsBreak 
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(exclusions, ',') AS e;

SELECT * FROM #exclusionsBreak;
```

SELECT p.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(tp.topping_name, ', ') as topping_name
FROM pizza_names as p
JOIN #toppingsBreak as tp on p.pizza_id = tp.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.pizza_name
```
  
| pizza_name  | topping_name                                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Meatlovers  | Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |

### Q4.Generate an order item for each record in the ```customers_orders``` table in the format of one of the following
* ```Meat Lovers```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef```
* ```Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers```

To solve this question:
* Create 3 CTEs: ```extras_cte```, ```exclusions_cte```, and ```union_cte``` combining two tables
* Use the ```union_cte``` to LEFT JOIN with the ```customer_orders_temp``` and JOIN with the ```pizza_name```
* Use the ```CONCAT_WS``` with ```STRING_AGG``` to get the result

```TSQL
WITH CTEs_Extra AS 
(
    SELECT e.record_id, 'Extra ' + STRING_AGG(p.topping_name, ', ') as record_options
    FROM #extrasBreak as e
    JOIN pizza_toppings as p on e.extra_id = p.topping_id
    GROUP BY e.record_id
), CTEs_Exclusion AS
(

    SELECT e.record_id, 'Exclusion ' + STRING_AGG(p.topping_name, ', ') as record_options
    FROM #exclusionsBreak as e
    JOIN pizza_toppings as p on e.exclusion_id = p.topping_id
    GROUP BY e.record_id
), CTEs_Union AS (
    SELECT * FROM CTEs_Extra
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM CTEs_Exclusion
)

SELECT 
    c.record_id,
    c.order_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.pizza_id,
    c.order_time,
    CONCAT_WS(' - ', p.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(u.record_options, ' - ')) AS pizza_info
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
    LEFT JOIN CTEs_Union u ON c.record_id = u.record_id
    JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
    c.record_id, 
    c.order_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.pizza_id,
    c.order_time,
    p.pizza_name
ORDER BY record_id;
```

## D. Pricing and Ratings
### Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```TSQL
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10 END) AS money_earned
FROM #customer_orders_temp as c
    JOIN pizza_names as p on c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
    JOIN #runner_orders_temp as r on c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation is NULL
```
| money_earned  |
|---------------|
| 138           |

---
### Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
* Add cheese is $1 extra
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138 	-- @basecost = result of the previous question

SELECT 
  @basecost + SUM(CASE WHEN p.topping_name = 'Cheese' THEN 2 ELSE 1 END) updated_money
FROM #extrasBreak e
    JOIN pizza_toppings p ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id;
```
| updated_money  |
|----------------|
| 145            |

---
### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ratings
CREATE TABLE ratings (
    order_id INT,
    rating INT
);
INSERT INTO ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,3),
  (2,5),
  (3,3),
  (4,1),
  (5,5),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,3);

 SELECT * FROM ratings;  
 ```
| order_id | rating  |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | 3       |
| 2        | 5       |
| 3        | 3       |
| 4        | 1       |
| 5        | 5       |
| 7        | 3       |
| 8        | 4       |
| 10       | 3       |

### Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
* ```customer_id```
* ```order_id```
* ```runner_id```
* ```rating```
* ```order_time```
* ```pickup_time```
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

```TSQL
SELECT 
    co.customer_id,
    ro.order_id,
    ro.runner_id,
    ra.rating,
    co.order_time,
    ro.pickup_time,
    DATEDIFF(minute, co.order_time, ro.pickup_time) as time_to_delivery,
    ro.duration as delivery_duration,
    ROUND(AVG((ro.distance*60/ro.duration)), 1) as average_speed,
    COUNT(co.order_id) as total_number_of_pizzas
FROM #customer_orders_temp as co
    JOIN #runner_orders_temp as ro on co.order_id = ro.order_id 
    JOIN ratings as ra on co.order_id = ra.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation is NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id, ro.order_id, ro.runner_id, ra.rating, co.order_time, ro.pickup_time, ro.duration
ORDER BY ro.order_id
  ```

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138

SELECT 
  @basecost AS revenue,
  SUM(distance)*0.3 AS runner_paid,
  @basecost - SUM(distance)*0.3 AS money_left
FROM #runner_orders_temp;
```
| revenue | runner_paid | money_left  |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 138     | 43.56       | 94.44       |
