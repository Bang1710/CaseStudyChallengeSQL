---
### Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```TSQL
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS time_difference
FROM #runner_orders_temp;
```
| time_difference|
|----------------|
| 30             |

### Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  r.runner_id,
  c.order_id,
  r.distance,
  r.duration AS duration_min,
  COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count, 
  ROUND(AVG(r.distance/r.duration*60), 1) AS avg_speed
FROM #runner_orders_temp r
JOIN #customer_orders_temp c
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY r.runner_id, c.order_id, r.distance, r.duration;
```
| runner_id | order_id | distance | duration_min | pizza_count | avg_speed  |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1         | 1        | 20       | 32           | 1           | 37.5       |

| 1         | 10       | 10       | 10           | 2           | 60         |
| 2         | 4        | 23.4     | 40           | 3           | 35.1       |
| 2         | 7        | 25       | 25           | 1           | 60         |

* Runner ```1``` had the average speed from 37.5 km/h to 60 km/h
* Runner ```2``` had the average speed from 35.1 km/h to 93.6 km/h. With the same distance (23.4 km), order ```4``` was delivered at 35.1 km/h, while order ```8``` was delivered at 93.6 km/h. There must be something wrong here!
* Runner ```3``` had the average speed at 40 km/h

**2. Add an identity column ```record_id``` to ```#customer_orders_temp``` to select each ordered pizza more easily**
```TSQL
ALTER TABLE #customer_orders_temp
ADD record_id INT IDENTITY(1,1);

SELECT *
FROM #customer_orders_temp;
```
  
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time              | record_id  |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|-------------------------|------------|

**3. Create a new temporary table ```extrasBreak``` to separate ```extras``` into multiple rows**
```TSQL
SELECT 
  c.record_id,
  TRIM(e.value) AS extra_id
INTO #extrasBreak 
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
  CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(extras, ',') AS e;

SELECT *

| 14        | 1         |
| 14        | 4         |

**4. Create a new temporary table ```exclusionsBreak``` to separate into ```exclusions``` into multiple rows**
```TSQL
SELECT 
  c.record_id,
  TRIM(e.value) AS exclusion_id
INTO #exclusionsBreak 
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
  CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(exclusions, ',') AS e;

SELECT *
FROM #exclusionsBreak;
```
  
| record_id | exclusion_id  |
|-----------|---------------|

### Q1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  p.pizza_name,
  STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS ingredients
FROM #toppingsBreak t
JOIN pizza_names p 
  ON t.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.pizza_name;
```
  
| pizza_name | ingredients                                                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meatlovers | Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami  |
| Vegetarian | Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce             |

---
### Q2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  p.topping_name,
  COUNT(*) AS extra_count
FROM #extrasBreak e
JOIN pizza_toppings p
  ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id
GROUP BY p.topping_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```
  
| topping_name | extra_count  |
|--------------|--------------|
| Bacon        | 4            |
| Cheese       | 1            |
| Chicken      | 1            |

The most commonly added extra was Bacon.

---
### Q3. What was the most common exclusion?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  p.topping_name,
  COUNT(*) AS exclusion_count
FROM #exclusionsBreak e
JOIN pizza_toppings p
  ON e.exclusion_id = p.topping_id
GROUP BY p.topping_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```
  
| topping_name | exclusion_count  |
|--------------|------------------|
| Cheese       | 4                |
| Mushrooms    | 1                |
| BBQ Sauce    | 1                |

The most common exclusion was Cheese.

---
### Q4.Generate an order item for each record in the ```customers_orders``` table in the format of one of the following
* ```Meat Lovers```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef```
* ```Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers```

To solve this question:
* Create 3 CTEs: ```extras_cte```, ```exclusions_cte```, and ```union_cte``` combining two tables
* Use the ```union_cte``` to LEFT JOIN with the ```customer_orders_temp``` and JOIN with the ```pizza_name```
* Use the ```CONCAT_WS``` with ```STRING_AGG``` to get the result

```TSQL
WITH cteExtras AS (
  SELECT 
    e.record_id,
    'Extra ' + STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
  FROM #extrasBreak e
  JOIN pizza_toppings t
    ON e.extra_id = t.topping_id
  GROUP BY e.record_id
), 
cteExclusions AS (
  SELECT 
    e.record_id,
    'Exclusion ' + STRING_AGG(t.topping_name, ', ') AS record_options
  FROM #exclusionsBreak e
  JOIN pizza_toppings t
    ON e.exclusion_id = t.topping_id
  GROUP BY e.record_id
), 
cteUnion AS (
  SELECT * FROM cteExtras
  UNION
  SELECT * FROM cteExclusions
)

SELECT 
  c.record_id,
  c.order_id,
  c.customer_id,
  c.pizza_id,
  c.order_time,
  CONCAT_WS(' - ', p.pizza_name, STRING_AGG(u.record_options, ' - ')) AS pizza_info
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
LEFT JOIN cteUnion u
  ON c.record_id = u.record_id
JOIN pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
  c.record_id, 
  c.order_id,
  c.customer_id,
  c.pizza_id,
  c.order_time,
  p.pizza_name
ORDER BY record_id;
```

## D. Pricing and Ratings
### Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```TSQL
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10 END) AS money_earned
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;
```
| money_earned  |
|---------------|
| 138           |

---
### Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
* Add cheese is $1 extra
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138 	-- @basecost = result of the previous question

SELECT 
  @basecost + SUM(CASE WHEN p.topping_name = 'Cheese' THEN 2
		  ELSE 1 END) updated_money
FROM #extrasBreak e
JOIN pizza_toppings p
  ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id;
```
| updated_money  |
|----------------|
| 145            |

### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ratings
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  order_id INT,
  rating INT);
INSERT INTO ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,3),
  (2,5),
  (3,3),
  (4,1),
  (5,5),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,3);

 SELECT *
 FROM ratings;
 ```
| order_id | rating  |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | 3       |
| 2        | 5       |
| 3        | 3       |
| 4        | 1       |
| 5        | 5       |
| 7        | 3       |
| 8        | 4       |
| 10       | 3       |

### Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
* ```customer_id```
* ```order_id```
* ```runner_id```
* ```rating```
* ```order_time```
* ```pickup_time```
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

```TSQL
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  c.order_id,
  r.runner_id,
  c.order_time,
  r.pickup_time,
  DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS mins_difference,
  r.duration,
  ROUND(AVG(r.distance/r.duration*60), 1) AS avg_speed,
  COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
GROUP BY 
  c.customer_id,
  c.order_id,
  r.runner_id,
  c.order_time,
  r.pickup_time, 
  r.duration;
  ```
| customer_id | order_id | runner_id | order_time              | pickup_time             | mins_difference | duration | avg_speed | pizza_count  |

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138

SELECT 
  @basecost AS revenue,
  SUM(distance)*0.3 AS runner_paid,
  @basecost - SUM(distance)*0.3 AS money_left
FROM #runner_orders_temp;
```
| revenue | runner_paid | money_left  |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 138     | 43.56       | 94.44       |
